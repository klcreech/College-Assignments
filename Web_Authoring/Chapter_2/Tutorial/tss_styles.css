be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved 
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under 
any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply 
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
