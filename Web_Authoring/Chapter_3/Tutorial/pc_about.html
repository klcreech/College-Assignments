       <h1>Our Company</h1>
       <img src="pc_photo6.png" alt="" />
       <p>We are a company located in Essex, Vermont, dedicated to 
          making delicious chocolate and other treats. For our founder, 
          chocolatier Anne Ambrose, this means using only the finest 
          organic ingredients, incorporating a harmonious blend of rich 
          flavors and smooth textures.</p>
       <p>Anne learned her trade as part of a three-year apprenticeship 
          program in Switzerland. Her introduction into the world of 
          confectioneries was a springboard to working with leaders in
          the field. Early in 1993 she brought that expertise back to 
          Vermont and Pandaisia Chocolates was born.</p>

      <h1>About Chocolate</h1>
      <article>
         <h1>Enjoying Chocolates</h1>
         <p>We believe that the best chocolate is fresh chocolate. 
          Preservatives change the flavor and texture of chocolate. 
          For the best results, our chocolates should be consumed 
          within a few days of purchase. Store them in a
          cool, dark place at a temperature of 60&deg; to 
          70&deg; such as a refrigerator or wine cellar.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
         <h1>Healthy Chocolate</h1>
         <p>Chocolate has a bad reputation because of the poor 
          quality of mass-produced bars loaded with lots of milk, 
          sugar, and butter &mdash; which are tasty but not 
          healthy. We start with organic ingredients, keep the 
          processed sugars to a minimum and produce dark chocolate 
          that is 73% cacao. At that level, you can reap the benefits 
          of a chocolate diet!</p>
      </article>
      <article>
         <h1>Single-Origin and Blends</h1>
         <p>We believe in single-origin chocolate made from one
         variety of cacao harvested from a single region. 
         Single-origin chocolates take on the unique flavors of 
         their region (in the same way that wines adopt regional
         distinctions.) Other chocolatiers use blends that combine 
         flavors from several regions. Let us know what you prefer.</p>

         <h1>Ethical Produce</h1>
         <p>We work directly with farmers in Peru, Ecuador, and Honduras, 
         where we learn first-hand about the economic struggles they 
         face. We pay above-market premiums to maintain our relationships 
         with farmers and support Fair Trade agreements. We are always striving to 
         foster a sustainable market for fine chocolate and to support 
         the hard-working men and women who are our producers.</p>

      <h1>FAQ</h1>
      <dl>
       <dt>Do you do weddings?</dt>
       <dd>Yes! That's our favorite thing to do. We sell bulk chocolates 
          in a wide variety of box designs perfect for weddings or 
          other special occasions.</dd>
       <dt>How long do your chocolates last?</dt>
       <dd>We recommend that you store our chocolates in a dark, cool 
          place and consume them within two weeks of purchase.</dd>
       <dt>What varieties are you selling?</dt>
       <dd>We're constantly updating our product list to match seasonal 
          expectations. Typically we have between 12 and 18 varieties at 
          any one time.</dd>
       <dt>Can I customize my own box?</dt>
       <dd>Of course! We have special gift boxes but if you want to 
          create a box of your favorites, we're glad to oblige.</dd>
       <dt>Can I request a special variety?</dt>
       <dd>We're happy to consider requests, but remember that some 
          varieties are seasonal and cannot always be made to order.</dd>
       <dt>What about peanut allergies?</dt>
       <dd>We can produce box sets without nuts, but our factory  is 
          not a nut-free environment, so some fragments might get 
          into your box however much we try to avoid it.</dd>
       <dt>Where is Pandaisia?</dt>
       <dd>Glad you asked. Pandaisia is not a place; it's the name of 
          the Greek goddess of the banquet and what's a banquet without 
          chocolate?</dd>
