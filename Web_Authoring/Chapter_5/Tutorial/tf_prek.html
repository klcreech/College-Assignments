         <h1>Pre-K Classes</h1>
         <p>As preschoolers gain more self-esteem, they feel ready to take on the world. 
            Our preschool curriculum enhances their confidence by providing activities to 
            help them become problem solvers and nurture a love of learning. With independent 
            exploration, structured activities, and hands-on learning, our children develop 
            a variety of skills and knowledge in areas from mathematics to reading.</p>
         <p>We're proud of the work we do. Early learning standards, backed by education experts,
            inform the scope and sequence of our pre-k program. Our curriculum aligns to  
            72 learning standards progressing sequentially across six developmental domains. 
            Add to this a healthy dose of running, jumping and movement to keep children active 
            and you'll see why <em>Trusted Friends</em> is a true leader in early 
            childhood education.</p>
      </article>
      
      <section id="topics">
         <article>
            <h1>Language Skills</h1>
            <p>Language, literacy, and communication skills are embedded into a child's 
               daily experiences. We strive to create meaningful classroom experiences that 
               help children use and build a growing vocabulary.</p>
         </article>
         <article>
            <h1>Math Exploration</h1>
            <p>Pre-k children are enthusiastic mathematicians. Our instructors work to ensure that 
               our students don't simply learn numbers by rote, but instead build mathematical 
               understanding related to real, everyday problems. Our curriculum includes 
               important skills such as comparing and contrasting items by characteristics, 
               following complex directions in sequence, and solving simple number problems.</p>
         </article>
         <article>
            <h1>Science Studies</h1>
            <p>As their cognitive and physical abilities develop, children are able to develop and test 
               their own theories, and to engage in scientific reasoning. Our curriculum encourages students 
               to broaden their understanding of scientific disciplines, from physics to chemistry to 
               earth science. Children learn by participating in cooking projects and participating in 
               multi-skill experiments, handling mechanical tools.</p>
         </article>
         <article>
            <h1>Creative Expressions</h1>
            <p>Pre-kindergarten is an ideal time to introduce children to artistic expression. Our 
               pre-k teachers extend their student's skills and knowledge through process-oriented art 
               projects. We teach sculpting with clay and etching tools, writing and illustrating books, 
               and our students experience acting out original stories with costumes, props, and masks.</p>
         </article>
         <article>
            <h1>Cultural Sharing</h1>
            <p>Children are innately interested in the diversity of people and cultures. We 
               foster the development of all areas of a child's emotional intelligence including interpersonal 
               skills, compassion, and acceptance of personal responsibility. We believe in fostering 
               respect for different cultures, traditions, and life styles.</p>
         </article>
         <article>
            <h1>Physical Wellness</h1>
            <p>Pre-k children learn about becoming responsible for their own choices and decisions. 
               Our curriculum encourages students to learn physical wellness through physical activity, 
               healthy eating, and personal hygiene. Everyday our children learn about themselves and 
               others through supportive sharing times.</p>
