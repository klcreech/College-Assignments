	<h1>What Your Support Does</h1>

    <p>Every 10 minutes a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer. Her first reaction 
    is fear and confusion. Support is just a phone call or mouse click away. Our 
    free services offer a friendly ear and expert guidance to anyone dealing with 
    this life-threatening illness.</p>

    <p>By running or walking with us, you can ensure 
    that we are there when people need us. Here is how your contribution can 
    help:</p>
	
	<ul>

	<h2>History</h2>

	<p>Since its inception in 2014, Diane's Run has grown from a purely local event involving
	100 runners to a signature Wyoming event with more than 2000 participants annually.
	The event is enormously effective in spreading the message that breast cancer need 
	not be fatal if caught early enough with mammography and regular breast self-exams. 
	As well as a top-flight athletic event, Diane's Run is an emotionally moving event
	attracting many first timers and recreational runners. This event provides all of 
	us with the opportunity to spread a hopeful message about breast cancer to our families
	and our communities.</p>


	<h2>Remembering Diane</h2>

	<p>Diane's Run is named in remembrance of Diane Wheaton, mother of two and wife
	of Peter, who passed away in May, 2013. Diane was an outspoken advocate of physical
	fitness and healthy living. She was an inspiration to all who knew her and continues
	to be an inspiration to the thousands of runners who have participated in this event.</p>

	<p>We hope you can join us this year and become part of the Diane's Run family.</p>
