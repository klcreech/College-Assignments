 * Kerry Creech
 * COP2805 - Homework #11_2
 * 1/21/2022
 * This program consist of Designing a class named Person
 * and its two subclasses named Student and Employee.
 * Make Faculty and Staff subclasses of Employee.
 * A person has a name, address, phone number, and 
 * email address. A student has a class status (freshman,
 * sophomore, junior, or senior). Define the status as a constant.
 * An employee has an office, salary, and date hired.
 * Use the MyDate class defined in Programming Exercise
 * 10.14 to create an object for date hired.
 * A faculty member has office hours and a rank.
 * A staff member has a title. Override the toString
 * method in each class to display the class name and the personâ€™s
 * name. Draw the UML diagram for the classes and implement them.
 * Write a test program that creates a Person, Student, Employee, 
 *Faculty, and Staff, and invokes their toString() methods.
